## Project Achievements:

1. **Design Excellence:**
   - The project's standout feature is its meticulous attention to design aesthetics. The color scheme, graphics, and motion design collectively contribute to an immersive user experience.

2. **Independent Debugging:**
   - During the development process, I took the initiative to independently debug the CSS code. This hands-on troubleshooting not only resolved issues efficiently but also significantly enhanced my debugging skills.

3. **Separation of Concerns Principle:**
   - One of the project's key architectural principles is the implementation of the Separation of Concerns (SoC) principle. This ensures a modular and maintainable codebase, promoting clarity and ease of future development.

4. **Confidence Boost:**
   - Successfully overcoming challenges and implementing best practices, such as SoC, has boosted my confidence in troubleshooting and developing robust web applications.
